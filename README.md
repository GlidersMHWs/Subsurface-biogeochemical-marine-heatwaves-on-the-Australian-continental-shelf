# Subsurface-biogeochemical-marine-heatwaves-on-the-Australian-continental-shelf
This repository contains processed glider datasets and a MATLAB script for analyzing subsurface marine heatwaves along the Australian continental shelf. The data are organized by region:
1. Queensland (QLD) – northeastern Australia
2. New South Wales (NSW) – southeastern Australia
3. Western Australia (SW WA) – southwest Australia
4. Tasmania (TAS) – eastern Tasmania

The included MATLAB script, glider_qc_regrid_vf.m, provides tools for quality control, regridding, and processing of glider observations, enabling investigation of subsurface biogeochemical characteristics during marine heatwaves.

# The dataset corresponds to the study:

# Contents
1. Archive_gliders_18092025-20260226T231052Z-1-001.zip – contains glider profiles from NSW, QLD, SW WA, and TAS.
2. glider_qc_regrid_vf.m – MATLAB processing script for glider data.
   
# Notes
Glider profile positions for each region are illustrated in the publication: QLD, NSW, SW WA, and TAS.
This repository provides the regional subset of data for reproducibility; the full dataset and high-resolution bathymetry are available from the original sources.
The script and data support exploration of subsurface metrics during marine heatwaves, as discussed in the referenced study.
